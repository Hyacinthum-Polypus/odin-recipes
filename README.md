# odin-recipes
This website will consist of a main index page which link to a few recipes.
This project will make use of html elements and tags. It will of course contain boilerplate html but also include text in the form of paragraphs with bold and italitized text.
The project will make use of ordered and unordered lists. It will also make use of anchor tags which will be used to link to recipes. Finally no website can go without including images.
# Recipes
There are three recipes: Quick and easy Spanish rice, banana banana bread and Chef John's chicken and mushrooms.
