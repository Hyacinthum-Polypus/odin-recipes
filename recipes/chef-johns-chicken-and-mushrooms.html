    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This chicken and mushrooms recipe is an experiment in extreme self-control. 
        I wanted to challenge myself to make a chicken and mushrooms recipe using only chcken and mushrooms.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breast halves, boneless, skin-on</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season chicken on all sides with salt and ground black pepper.</li>

        <li>Turn chicken over; stir mushrooms with a pinch of salt into skillet. Increase heat to high; cook, stirring mushrooms occasionallly, until mushrooms shrink slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken breast to a plate and loosely tent with foil; set aside.</li>
        <li>Set skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat; cook and stir mushrooms until brown bits start to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Pour water into the skillet, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. Cook until water is reduced by hald, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in anyu accumulated juices from the chicken into the skillet. Stir butter into mushroom mixture, stirring constantly until butter is competely melted and incorporated.</li>
